**Copy Examples by Category:**

**Clumping:**
"We tested 87 clumping cat litters. Most were garbage. These 8 actually clump properly (and don't turn into cement)."

**Natural:**
"We tested 43 'natural' cat litters. Half were mediocre clay with green marketing. Here are the 6 that are actually worth the premium price."

**Budget:**
"We tested every litter under $15. Most were dusty trash. These 5 actually work (and won't destroy your lungs or wallet)."

**Odor Control:**
"We tested odor control with actual ammonia meters in sealed chambers. These 7 litters actually neutralize smell instead of just covering it up."

## What Makes a Good [Category] Cat Litter?

[3-4 paragraphs explaining category specifics]

Example for Clumping:
"Good clumping litter needs to do 3 things: form solid clumps that don't break, control odor, and minimize dust. Most products fail at least one of these.

We tested 87 clumping litters. Here's what separated winners from trash:

**Clump Strength:** The clump needs to hold together when you scoop it. We drop-tested clumps from 12 inches. Winners stayed intact. Losers crumbled.

**Dust Levels:** We measured particulates with an air quality monitor. Winners had <0.05mg per pour. Losers created visible clouds and measured 10x higher.

**Odor Control:** We used ammonia meters in sealed containers. Winners neutralized 85%+ of ammonia. Losers just masked it with fragrance."

## How We Tested [Category] Litters

[Detailed testing methodology specific to this category]

## [Category] Litter FAQ

### What's the best clumping cat litter?
Dr. Elsey's Ultra scored 9.4/10 in our testing. It's genuinely dust-free (0.03mg particulates), forms rock-solid clumps, and lasts 30% longer than competitors. Worth the 30% price premium if dust bothers you.

### Is expensive clumping litter worth it?
Depends on what you're paying for. Dr. Elsey's costs $0.51/day vs $0.43/day for basic Tidy Cats. That extra $2.40/month gets you zero dust and better clumps. Worth it if dust matters. Not worth it if you're just paying for marketing.

### How often should you change clumping litter?
With daily scooping: completely change every 3-4 weeks. Without daily scooping: every 1-2 weeks. We tested longevity and good clumping litter (like Dr. Elsey's) lasts 30% longer than basic options.

# Best Clumping Cat Litter (2024)

We tested 87 clumping cat litters over 6 months.

We spent $4,200 buying products and 347 hours testing dust levels, clumping strength, and odor control with actual equipment (not just opinions).

Most clumping litters suck. They either:
→ Create dust clouds that coat everything near the box
→ Form clumps that crumble when you try to scoop
→ Cost 3x more for "premium" that performs the same as basic

These 8 products actually work. They earned their spots through real performance, not marketing budgets.

**Last Updated:** January 15, 2024 | **Products Tested:** 87 | **Test Duration:** 6 months
