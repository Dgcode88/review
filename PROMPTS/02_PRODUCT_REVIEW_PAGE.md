**Copy Style for Quick Verdict:**
```
After testing this for 90 days with 6 different cats, here's the truth:

This is the best clumping litter we've tested if you prioritize dust control and rock-solid clumps. You'll pay 30% more than basic clay, but you'll scoop 40% less often and deal with zero dust clouds.

Worth it if: You're sensitive to dust or want the lowest-maintenance option
Skip it if: You're on a tight budget or prioritize natural materials
```

### 8. FAQ Section (Schema Markup)

Q: Is this actually dust-free or is that marketing?
A: We measured 0.03mg particulates per pour. That's 94% less than average clay. Not zero, but close enough that you won't see visible dust.

Q: How long does a 40lb bag last?
A: Single cat: 6-8 weeks. Two cats: 4-5 weeks. Based on daily scooping.

Q: Is it worth the premium price?
A: If dust control is your priority: yes. If you just need basic odor control: probably not.
```

## Copywriting Guidelines for Reviews

### Be Brutally Honest
**WRONG:** "This is a great litter with excellent clumping."
**RIGHT:** "The clumping is legitimately the best we've tested. But you'll pay 30% more and it's heavy as hell. Worth it if dust bothers you. Not worth it if you're price-sensitive."

### Use Specific Measurements
**WRONG:** "Very low dust"
**RIGHT:** "0.03mg particulates per pour - that's 94% less than the average clay litter"

### Explain Value Equation
**WRONG:** "Premium price"
**RIGHT:** "$0.62/day vs $0.42/day for basic clay. That extra $0.20/day gets you zero dust and 30% longer-lasting clumps. Worth it if dust matters to you."

### Address Real Concerns
**WRONG:** "Works great for odor!"
**RIGHT:** "Odor control is good (8/10) but not the best we've tested. If you have 3+ cats in a small space, you might want something stronger. For 1-2 cats, this handles smell fine."

## Example Review Excerpts

### Opening (Quick Verdict):
```
We tested Dr. Elsey's Ultra for 90 days with 6 different cats.

The verdict: This is the best dust-free clumping litter we've tested, period. You'll pay 30% more than basic Tidy Cats, but you get genuinely zero visible dust and rock-solid clumps that make scooping take half the time.

Worth buying if you prioritize dust control or want less frequent scooping.
Skip it if you're on a budget or need natural/flushable options.
```

### Performance Section:
```
Dust Control: 9.0/10

We poured 2 cups from 24 inches up, 10 different times, and measured particulate levels with an air quality monitor.

Result: 0.03mg per pour. That's 94% less than the average clay litter.

Translation: You will not see dust clouds. Period. We couldn't create one even when purposely trying to. If you have asthma, allergies, or just hate cleaning dust off surfaces near the litter box, this is your winner.
```

### Value Section:
```
Value: 8.0/10

Let's do the math:
• 40lb bag costs $24.99 (Amazon)
• Lasts 7 weeks for a single cat with daily scooping
• Cost: $0.51/day

Compare to Tidy Cats (basic):
• 35lb bag costs $14.99
• Lasts 5 weeks
• Cost: $0.43/day

You're paying $0.08/day more ($2.40/month) for:
→ Zero dust vs constant dust clouds
→ Clumps that don't break vs clumps that crumble
→ 30% less litter usage overall

Worth it? If dust bothers you at all, absolutely. If you're extremely price-sensitive and dust doesn't matter, stick with basic options.
```
